# Logistics-Regression-Breast-Cancer-NKI-Dataset
This project gives an overview of how to go ahead with a binary classification problem, more specifically Logistics Regression and the steps involved in it.
The desired results may vary depending on the type of dataset and the speed of the machine. 
We have not done a lot of EDA on the above dataset. However exploring individual parameters can also lead to more insights about the patient.
